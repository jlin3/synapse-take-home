**Subject:** Synapse Engineering Take-Home Assessment

Hi [Name],

Thanks for your interest in the Senior Full-Stack Engineer role at Synapse. As the next step, we'd like you to complete a short take-home assessment.

**What it is:** You'll build a direct messaging feature for our research platform using React Native (Expo), backed by a live test API we've set up for you. The full spec, API docs, and starter project are in the repo below.

**Repo:** https://github.com/jlin3/synapse-take-home

**Time budget:** ~3 hours. We know you're busy — don't spend more than that. We're evaluating how you think and build, not whether you finish every last detail.

**Due date:** [DATE — 5 days from send]. Submit by pushing to a GitHub repo (public or private with us invited) and sending us the link.

**Getting started:** Clone the repo, run `cp .env.example .env && yarn install && npx expo start`, and read the `ASSESSMENT.md` file for the full instructions. The API is already live and pre-configured — you should see "API connected" on the welcome screen right away.

If you have any questions about the API, setup, or scope, don't hesitate to reach out to jesse@synapsesocial.com. We'd rather you ask than guess.

Good luck!
